# Hi, I’m @willisman31

I'm a senior finishing my degree at James Madison University's college of business majoring in Computer Information Systems.  My expected graduation is December, 2021 with a BBA

I have attained IT certifications from CompTIA in the Sec+ and AWS in the Cloud Practitioner.

I'm currently learning more about cybersecurity for large networks and am studying for my CCENT.
