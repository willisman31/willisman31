# Hi, I’m @willisman31

I’m interested in information security and machine learning

I’m currently learning about machine learning in [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)'s deep learning for coders course.  I'm learning about information security using [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/)'s information security course.

I'm a junior enrolled in James Madison University's college of business majoring in Computer Information Systems.  My expected graduation is May, 2022 with a BBA
